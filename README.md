# Version Control System (VCS) with GUI

A lightweight **Version Control System** built with a **C++ backend** and a **Python GUI frontend** using `customtkinter`. This project enables users to **create repositories**, **add/update files**, **commit changes with timestamped versions**, and **revert files** to previous commits. It also provides a **diff feature** to compare the current file content with the latest committed version.

The Python GUI offers a modern interface with panels for **repositories**, **files**, **commit history**, and an **editable workspace**. Users receive **real-time suggestions** and can perform common VCS operations via **voice commands** (`init`, `add`, `update`, `commit`, `revert`).

This project demonstrates **core version control concepts**, **file management**, and integration of **GUI with backend logic**, making it ideal for beginners to explore **VCS functionality** and **interactive desktop applications**.
